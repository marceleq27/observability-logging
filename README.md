# Observability: logging in Golang with EFK

The talk covers most popular logging frameworks in Golang and the Elasticsearch-Fluentd-Kibana stack. Traditionally, you will find a demo that you can run with a single command to continoue learning on your own.

The three parts of the observability: monitoring, the first, but often the second; logging the second, but often the first; tracking the heavy weight boxer that comes the last.

- [live-demo](demo_go/) run with a single command.

My recommendation, start with monitoring before investing in the centralized logging. Check my previous talk on [monitoring with Prometheus stack](https://github.com/wojciech12/talk_monitoring_with_prometheus).
